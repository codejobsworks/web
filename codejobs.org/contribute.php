        <h3>You can contribute in many different ways:</h3>

        <ul>
         <h3><li>Developing CodeJobs.org</li></h3>
         CodeJobs.org platform is divided into two parts. One part is the website, which is the public and which is<br /> 
         dynamically generated in various parts. <br /><br />
         
         The source code is in the following repository:<br /><br />

         <a href="https://github.com/codejobsworks/web" target="_blank">https://github.com/codejobsworks/web</a><br /><br />

         Another part is the application that "manages" the contents. With it we facilitate the work of providing the service<br /> 
         and we investigate new forms of presentation of tasks and resources.<br /><br />

         The source code is in the following repository:<br /><br />

         <a href="https://github.com/codejobsworks/app" target="_blank">https://github.com/codejobsworks/app</a><br /><br />

         If you wish to help, you can just clone repositories and begin to create / modify until you get a result. <br />

         <h3><li>Donating some resources</li></h3>
         We have to pay for maintenance of the server, domains, and certain expenses of the people that manage <br />
         the platformm, approximately: <b>200 â‚¬ / year</b><br /><br />

         Anyway, we accept donations almost anything. This includes <b>hours of time</b> and come (gadgets, food, etc.)<br />
